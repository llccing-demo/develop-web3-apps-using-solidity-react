# Introduction to Web3.0

## History of the web

### Web 1.0

focus on providing information and resources to users. rather than allowing users to actively contribute or interact with the content on websites.

### Web 2.0

Allowed users to create, share, and exchange information and content online in a more interactive and collaborative way.

Issues like Denial of Service(Dos) attacks, censorship, third-party interference, downtime, etc.

The data and content are centralized in a small group of companies referred to the "Big Tech". 

*Big Four*, Google, Amazon, Fackbook, Apple, known as GAFA. GAMA, cause facebook rebranded itself as Meta.

*Big Five*, GAMA add Microsoft.

### Web 3.0

The term Web 3.0 (also known as Web3) was coined by Polkadot's and Ethereum's cofounder Gavin Wood in 2014, referring to the "Decentralized online ecosystem based on blockchain."


## Ethereum and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

Ethereum is a blockchain-based implementation of Web3. It's a platform that runs smart contracts.

EVM prevents DOS attacks and ensures taht programs do not have access to each other's states, ensuring the ability to establish without any potential interference.

## Smart contracts

Ethereum introduced smart contracts, which are considered the building blocks of decentralized finance(DeFi) and are associated with cryptocurrencies. 

Smart contracts dismiss the need for intermediates and arbitration costs, and exclude the possibility of fraud.

## Solididty

Solidity is a high-level, object and contract-oriented language influenced by C++, JavaScript, and Python.

It works with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

# Introduction to Solidity and Smart Contract Development

## Web3 Apps and Initialization and Execution of Contracts

## Challenge: Create a Contract

```shell
use command `node scripts/run.js` or
~/projects/github/educative/develop-web3-apps-using-solidity-react/partnerly-contract$ npm run dev

> partnerly-contract@1.0.0 dev
> node scripts/run.js

Nothing to compile
Partnership contract deployed
Partnership deployed to: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
```

as the result uppper, I completed my first contract

## Details of the Contract

## Challenge: Create a Contract with Attritubes and Functions

## Smart Contracts Continued

Add split ratios to contract and add test

## Requiring Valid Arguments

Test first, TDD, test drive development.

A `pure` function means that the operation inside the function doesnâ€™t rely on any external state.

## Challenge: Split Ratios

## Receiving Payments

## Sending Payments

## Challenge: Create a Contract That Accepts Payments

## Solution: Create a Contract That Accepts Payments

## Preventing Overdrawing from the Account

## Finalizing the run Script

## Quiz 3: Payments
